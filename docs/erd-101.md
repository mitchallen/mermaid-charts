Entity Relationship Diagrams

### 1:1 Mapping

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Person {
        int person_id
        string first_name
        string last_name
        date birth_date
    }
    Passport {
        int passport_id
        string passport_number
        date issue_date
        date expiry_date
        int person_id
    }
    Person ||--|| Passport : "has"
```

This diagram represents that each **Person** has one **Passport** and each **Passport** is assigned to one Person.

### 1:M (1 to Many) relationship

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Author {
        int author_id
        string first_name
        string last_name
        date birth_date
    }
    Book {
        int book_id
        string title
        date publication_date
        int author_id
    }
    Author ||--o{ Book : "writes"
```

In this diagram, each Author can write many Books, but each Book is written by only one Author.

### M:M (Many to Many) relationship

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Student {
        int student_id
        string first_name
        string last_name
        date birth_date
    }
    Course {
        int course_id
        string course_name
        string course_description
    }
    Enrollment {
        int enrollment_id
        int student_id
        int course_id
        date enrollment_date
    }
    Student ||--o{ Enrollment : enrolls
    Course ||--o{ Enrollment : includes
```

In this diagram, each Student can enroll in many **Courses**, and each **Course** can have many **Students** enrolled in it. The **Enrollment** table handles the many-to-many relationship between **Student** and **Course**.

### Product / Order / Line Item example

Below is an **Entity-Relationship Diagram** (**ERD**) in Mermaid that shows the relationship between an **Order** table, a **LineItem** table, and a **Product** table.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Order {
        int order_id
        date order_date
        int customer_id
    }
    LineItem {
        int line_item_id
        int order_id
        int product_id
        int quantity
        decimal price
    }
    Product {
        int product_id
        string product_name
        decimal price
        string description
    }
    Order ||--o{ LineItem : contains
    Product ||--o{ LineItem : listed_in
```

In this diagram:

Each **Order** can contain multiple **LineItem** entries.
Each **LineItem** is associated with a single **Order** and a single **Product**.
Each **Product** can be listed in multiple **LineItem** entries.

### Maps To

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ITEMS ||--o| PRODUCE_LOOKUP_CODE : maps_to
    ITEMS {
        int item_id PK
    }
    PRODUCE_LOOKUP_CODE {
        int lookup_code_id PK
        int item_id FK
    }
```
